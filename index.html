    <h1>Yet another JS framework</h1>
    <div>
        In my day job I mainly use React, but recently I have been making a lot of stuff without any frameworks at all,
        and it is quite enjoyable thanks to the new ecmascript syntax, mainly the `${}` template literals, a lot of stuff that was painful
        is now super easy in vanilla-js, although it can get a bit verbose at times.

        However, there are still a few thing that are really easy in React but are quite a pain in vanillaJS.
        This is my attempt at making a couple of helper methods that will cover those things while also work alongside the vanilla-js way of doing things
        and adding little overhead.

        <li>Reuseablility - need a good pattern to make reuseable components</li>
        <li>
            Reactivity + Conditional rendering and List rendering - need a good pattern to conditionally render a thing
            based on a value, and
            hide or show it based on some value. Also need a good pattern to render a list of items, and respond to
            changes in that list.
